# Group 7: Fro7en 
This respository contains code for the Olaf Line Following Robot and Servo component.

Robot will follow a track outlined with black electrical tape.  
2 IR sensors are used to follow the track by providing feedback information to the Arduino board. 
The robotâ€™s direction is controlled via the Arduino board turning on an off switches located on the H-Bridge.  
The robot speed is determined by a numerical value chosen by the user and stored as an input variable in the code.
